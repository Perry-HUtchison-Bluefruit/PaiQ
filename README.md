Youll need to add a secret.py file with the following:

project_ID = "found on edge impulse URL while in target project"
API_Key = "ei_XXXfound in DashBoard/Keys in your EI project"
deploy_type = "rp2040"
device_ID = "found in devices in your EI project - may need to add device first"
device_name = "DEVICENAME"
device_type = "RASPBERRY_PI_RP2040"
